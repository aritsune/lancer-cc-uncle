        "question": "Does Invisibility work against tech attacks? Do Reliable weapons deal their damage on a miss when the miss is caused by Invisibility? Are area-of-effect weapons affected by Invisibility?",
        "answer": "Invisibility in Lancer is fairly straightforward. All incoming attacks, whether they're ranged, melee, or tech, have a 50% chance to miss before the attack roll is made. This applies to area-of-effect attacks just as much as single target attacks. If an attack made against an Invisible target misses due to the 50% miss chance, that is a miss and it triggers any effects that may be activated on a miss, including Reliable damage.",

        "question": "Does the Saladin's Paracausal Mod bypass half-damage effects?",

    {
        "question": "How does Resistance to Burn work? Does it halve the end of turn damage *twice*?",
        "answer": "It does not. Resistance to Burn only affects the initial damage, and not the end-of-turn ticks. If you take 4 Burn and resist it, you will take 2 Burn damage and mark 2 Burn stacks, but you will take 2 Burn damage if you fail the EOT check.",

        "answer": "Yes. When you make an attack with a Skirmish or Barrage that grants a bonus auxiliary weapon attack you can choose the order those weapons attack in. However, bonus auxiliary weapon attacks will still not deal bonus damage even if they come first.",

        "answer": "This is a slight misprint. Ordnance should read \" This weapon can only be fired before the user moves or takes any other actions on a turn.\" Ordnance weapons can be used outside of your turn with various reactions (except for Overwatch which is explicitly disallowed) as long as you abide by the tag's other restrictions.",

        "answer": "You can choose to apply on hit or on crit effects in whatever order you choose, including before damage from the attack in question. So when you critically hit with a Chain Axe you can choose to apply the Shredded condition to the target before dealing damage, preventing them from benefitting from armor or resistance.",

Narratively SEKHMET may be in \"control\" of things but you, the player, are still playing, it's just you have a series of restrictions and conditions on what actions and maneuvers you can try to take. You still control the mech and can make decisions within those restrictions as you like.",

        "answer": "The latter. Bursts always measure their size from the targeted point. If a Burst is centered on a mech then you use that as the point of origin, but if launched away from the mech such as with Throughbolt Rounds the Burst will use the end of the line as its center point instead.",

        "question": "If I position the two Blast areas of a Pinaka Missiles attack so that they both hit a size 2 or size 3 target without overlapping, does this hit that target twice?",
        "answer": "No. The Pinaka Missiles are still treated as a single attack, just one with a custome area-of-effect that consists of two Blast areas. Even if you place both Blasts in a way that they could hit a single target without overlapping, you still only roll to hit that target once.",

        "answer": "No, when the Regeneration trait is disabled you do not regain any HP at the end of your next turn, even though both reactivating the trait and regaining HP happen \"at the end of your next turn.\" The trait simply reactivates. The next opportunity you'll have to regain HP with the Regeneration trait will be end of the turn after that.",

        "question": "Is the Gravity Gun affected by Invisibility?",
        "answer": "No. The Gravity Gun's use is, technically speaking, an attack. If your mech is unable to make attacks for some reason, such as being Jammed, it cannot use the Gravity Gun. But the actual effect of the Gravity Gun when you attack with it is one that has no associated to hit roll of any sort, functioning instead more like a grenade or mine, and so there's no way for it to \"miss\" like a regular attack would, even if the target is Invisible. This also means that the Gravity Gun does not benefit from anything that would trigger on hit or on crit since it can do neither of those things.",

If you attempt to create a Blinkshield within a Blinkshield and any part of the two shields overlap or intersect, you cannot do so as it would violate the clause that states that no effect can cross the Blinkshield.",

        "answer": "No. Strictly speaking, combat actions such as Stabilize don't really \"exist\" outside of combat. When resting or during downtime the Stabilize action isn't something you take, you have other options for repairing your mech available to you, the same way that if you were looking to use your mech to shoot at a guard tower during a narrative scene you wouldn't declare \"I use a Skirmish,\" you would simply state your intent to shoot the tower.",
