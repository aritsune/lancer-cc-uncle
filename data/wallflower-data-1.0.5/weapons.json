    "description": "Popular among colonial militias, the plasma maul is a heavy but simple device. High-density magnetic plasma capacitors have a wide range of applications, from power storage through to construction and defense. In the case of the plasma maul, they are mounted in rows along a reinforced haft and set to discharge on contact, making this a devastating closequarters weapon limited only by its need to recharge between strikes. Early models featured ejectable capacitor banks, but contemporary versions are designed to draw power directly from a chassis’ reactor.",

    "description": "An obsolete chassis-grade anti-materiel/ anti-armor rifle dating back to the Hercynian Crisis, this particular design has not been in distribution for hundreds of years but finds continued use among contemporary Hercynian forces. Bulkier and more cumbersome than the current GMS T-3 anti-materiel rifle, this particular model lacks many of the refinements incorporated into later models and is meant to be employed with a dedicated spotter to provide targeting data. All the same, its heavy, highvelocity rounds remain extremely effective at defeating both armor and static defenses at extreme range.",

    "description": "The “steelpunch”, as it’s affectionately known, is a twin-beam directed-energy weapon developed by HUC engineers for use against the heavily reinforced hulls of remnant chassis and other hardened targets. The earliest models were derived from Second Committee–era mineral surveying lasers. An initial beam flash-vaporizes the target’s outer layer and the plasma bloom is instantly analyzed for material density and structural composition, following which the needlebeam fires a focused, highintensity pulsed beam tuned to defeat heavy armor. Performance against softer targets is significantly reduced, however, as excessive material ablation disrupts the secondary beam before an optimal effect can be achieved.",
