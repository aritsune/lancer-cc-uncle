Non-intangible characters can move through intangible characters but not end their turns inside their spaces. An intangible character cannot interact with, affect, or target any other object or character (e.g. taking or dealing damage) in any way, and vice versa. They cannot capture points or count for zones (for sitreps) and donâ€™t count as adjacent to other characters.<br>There is one exception to this rule - intangible characters can interact with each other normally."
