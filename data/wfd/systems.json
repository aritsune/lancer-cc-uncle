We needed to find a way to make it... more. More visual, tactile, concrete, imposing, thrilling — we needed to sell the next step in realspace control! So with some tuning and, regrettably, input from Visual, we figured out how to define the White Witch: as the most terrifying, alien thing you’ve ever fucking seen.”",
