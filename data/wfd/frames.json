    "description": "A proof-of-concept more than a line production chassis, a select few White Witch models have been released via Smith Shimano’s LUX-EXOTIC group, only available to select pilots outside of SSC’s Constellar security services. The White Witch builds from the platform established by the Black Witch; utilizing SSC’s magtech weapons and equipment, the White Witch takes the BW platform and tunes it for hyper-solipsistic focus, narrowing the effect cone to encompass only the WW and its pilot.<br>The White Witch marks SSC’s first foray into null-ordinance/ environmental manipulation chassis: when active, the WW’s entire chassis becomes a conduit for onboard base-compound magtech agitators to exploit its immediate environment, drawing atomic components out of natural, organic, and inorganic objects and surfaces to enhance its built-in defensive systems. The White Witch reorganizes these molecular draws using its chassis as substrate, quickly forming substantive defenses and weapons from “thin air”.<br>This process has understandably traumatic effects on organic and inorganic materials inside the immediate effect cone.",

    "description": "“In Exotic Materials we don’t have problems. We have doors that are not yet open to us — a ‘problem’ presents endless branching paths; ‘doors’ are binary. Open and shut. The tyranny of the problem lies in the impossible breadth of possibility — a useless framing for tinkerers and hobbyists with time to fret over ethics as-defined by calcified, hand-wringing institutions. EXMAT instead is solutions-focused: there is no such thing as a problem, only a door, and the question: can we open it, or do we have to bash it down?<br>For the Emperor we had to bash the door down. Ugly process but the content beyond the door is more than worth it: Syncretic subjectivities, induced gestalt manifestation, H-NHP ontologic bridging, superpositional defensive lensing — look at what the battering ram gave us and tell me you’d rather puzzle out a problem then bash down the door.<br>Progress. The Corpro has always been about progress. Humanity has always been about progress. In service of progress, one must accept the necessity of teleological suspension, for it gives us wondrous, necessary things.<br> What else is there to say? Long live the Emperor, for in its creation did we find the method by which to fling open every locked door. Wondrous things are coming, and I’m glad as hell that they’ll be under our control.”<br>— Memo to personal records, Bala Shimano, CEO-1, Exotic Materials Group",
