At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the save, freeing both of you on success. As a quick action on your turn, you can break this immobilization effect on both of you to whip your target away, knocking them back 4 spaces in any direction. Otherwise you both remain immobilized.",

There’s no such thing as thin air, not in the way one means it when they use that phrase. ‘Agreeable Atomic Space’ — that’s what ‘thin air’ really is. A place where one could — if one could — coalesce utility from useless particulate mass with a thought. With a snap of our finger. Here, watch this —“",

    "description": "“Ultimately, I have to return to the core of what we made, the code we cracked when we finally figured out NO/EM. From a simple prompt, we created a terrible engine. I am more proud of what we did than anything I’ve ever worked on before, but it should never see the light of day. Working with Visual convinced me of this: it’s their job to translate our work to sales, and they could not. If the translator cannot understand the text... then who are they to re-write it? Who is the reader to attempt to access it? I conclude my summary with this: mothball the platform. There are less terrible paths we can walk.",
