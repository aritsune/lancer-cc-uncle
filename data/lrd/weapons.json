Terashima blades are perfectly balanced and tempered, scalable from personal use to Schedule 3 — when combined with a frames’ weapon and sensor suites, they have been proven to be fast and durable enough to deflect weapons fire. Each blade crafted by the Terashima enclave is an heirloom produced once and delivered via conventional travel — their loss is considered an indescribable humiliation of the owner, and an incredible triumph by the one who has taken it. The Terashima enclave keeps the casting mold of each blade produced, and displays them in their central hall with known histories attached.",
