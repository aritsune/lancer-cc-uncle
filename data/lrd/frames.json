    "description": "Originally commissioned as a dueling mech by the Baronic Houses of Smoke and Order, the Atlas blurs the line between mechanized chassis and powered personal armor. Thanks to a long-running research project from SSC's Exotic Materials Group, the designers were able to employ the bleeding edge of reactor miniaturization tech: the result was a chassis that resembled a large, sleek hardsuit, almost skintight in places. While the Atlas sacrifices the durability of a larger frame, its essential systems are so closely melded with its user's movements that it offers unparalleled maneuverability.</p> <p>Although the Atlas was initially licensed only to Baronic clients, its design was leaked when a group of ExoMat personnel lost a suit to a Sparri espada in an intense game of Kapkat. Despite their initial attempt to recover the suit, SSC relented, citing the eager demand from Sparri groups for access to the full license. </p> <p>Considered the perfect warrior frame for hunting the native megafauna of Sparr, the Atlas now enjoys a dual reputation among both the Sparri peoples and Karrakin nobility. To the Sparri, the Atlas &ndash; its combat efficacy notwithstanding &ndash; is highly valued for the direct access its systems allow to their ancestral memory; Atlas frames on Sparr are the heirlooms of great warriors, tied to family (blood and chosen) and maintained by hand. Each suit on Sparr bears the history of its previous pilots in both decorations and FCA-compliant machine learning, which enables Sparri hunters to almost literally call upon their ancestors in battle. The Atlas has become so popular among the Sparri that they even developed a new martial art based on the Atlas: Jäger Kunst. </p> <p>The Karrakin nobility, on the other hand, find the Atlas to be a perfect machine for noble heroism &ndash; that the Sparri have an affinity for it only makes the chassis that much more desirable among Karrakin Sparrist scholars. Commonly decorated with purchased Sparri saga discs, Vast pelts, and saga lines, Karrakin suits blend imagined profiles of Annorum Passacaglia and Annorum Tyrannus-era heroes with profiles of Sparri warriors, daredevils, vast-hunters, and espadas.",

    "description": "The Caliban is a relative newcomer in Interplanetary-Northstar’s line of single-client, chassis, already garnering a reputation among Trunk Security for its efficacy inside of the envelope for which it was designed; unlike many of IPS-N’s modern chassis, the Caliban has no civilian analog or antecedent; it was designed from the ground up to be a military machine.<br>The Caliban is IPS-N’s solution to the Yemanova Problem, or, the Impact-Override Problem. Capital ships, the problem notes, are incredibly expensive and time consuming for corpros and diasporan states to produce and maintain, and anti-ship weaponry has far outstripped capital defenses. In a conventional capital duel, a successful kill means the death of thousands of personnel and the loss of millions of units of manna; this leads many commanders to be gun-shy, relying on subline and fighter-class vessels to accomplish battle objectives rather than risk their big ships — a strategy that proves just as costly on average; instead of one or a handful of large ships being destroyed and signifying the end of a battle, engagements grind on for weeks as squadrons of smaller ships engage inside the unpredictability gap, inching towards victory.<br>IPS-N was the first to crack the Yemanova Problem. Their designers identified the need for a rapidly deployable, sub-signature, directed weapon or weapon system; well armed and armored, small enough to enter a ship and efficiently neutralize personnel in order to achieve victory. IPS-N created the Caliban to solve this mission need.<br>The mechanized chassis, cultural critics argue, venerates a particular humanity’s form, and is an unconscious nod towards the anthrochauvinist roots of the machine among leading chassis designers and fabricators. The Caliban is not that. It was never intended to be an image of man writ large, striding across the battlefield heroically to affect a greater purpose.<br>The Caliban has no roots, as many IPS-N chassis do, in the early efforts of freighter crews and asteroid miners to defend themselves. It was not born from ingenuity - there is no legacy of resilience, heroism, and the frontier spirit to paper over the purpose of its birth. It has no civilian applications in aid, disaster relief, construction, or farming.<br>It does not build, defend, or inspire. It was designed to solve a numbers problem on a ledger. It was only made small so it could to fit through most ship doors and bulkheads with minimal problems, crawl up the spinal corridors of ships, and speed up it’s average job completion rate by five minutes.<br>It is a tool designed to kill human beings very, very quickly.",

A relative unknown before the incident, her convoy was attacked by the White Tiger pirate conglomerate and her entire company was KIA.<br>Xiaoli’s Raleigh was almost totally ripped apart in the ensuing chaos, but she managed to activate a distress beacon and attach it to her mech. Over the next forty five days she survived by scavenging the collapsing and melting wreck of the huge transport ship M.S. Say No More, managing to outsmart the fifty or so pirates searching for her by steadily modifying her mech for unarmed, CQB combat. In an tight, close environment where the ship’s decaying reactor core made combustible ranged weapons incredibly dangerous, she showed incredible efficacy and ingenuity. Xiaoli did not survive, perishing hours before the relief fleet arrived, but bought enough time that MSMC was able to position itself to both resupply the colony, fulfilling its contract, and deal a mortal blow to the Tigers, wiping the pirates out completely in the following skirmishes. Her mech was purchased by IPS-N frame development and the Zheng was introduced shortly afterwards based on her improvements.<br>Xiaoli is widely regarded as a Bodhisattva by many Long Rim colonists and nearly all MSMC mercs are familiar with the several drinking games named after her.",
