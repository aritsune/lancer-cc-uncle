This does not count as DISMOUNT and the mech can’t be controlled from outside, so it will idle unless it is capable of acting independently (e.g., if it has an NHP that has been given control, which you can do as part of this protocol). <br>While in rodeo, your pilot becomes a valid target and can take damage normally. If you lose your personal shield for any reason, you are immediately forced back inside your mech, ending the effect, and you cannot start a rodeo again on your following turn. You can also end a rodeo as a quick action on any of your turns. <br>While in rodeo, your pilot can only take these actions:</p> <ul> <li>Extinguish (full action): You immediately clear all Burn affecting your mech, and it gains Resistance to Burn until the start of your next turn.</li> <li>Field Repair (full action): Your mech gains Overshield 2 and clears either Slowed or Immobilized.</li> <li>Rig Vents (full action): Your mech clears 2 Heat and clears either Impaired or Jammed.</li> </ul><br>Conditions that were self inflicted cannot be cleared with these actions."
