Your pilot can also climb back inside as a quick action.<br>While jockeying your pilot can take only the Fight or Reload actions, or any of the following actions:<li>Extinguish (full action): Immediately end any burn affecting your mech, and your pilot and mech gain resistance to burn until the start of your next turn.<li>Field Repair (full action): Heal your mech 2 hp and end the slowed condition on it.
